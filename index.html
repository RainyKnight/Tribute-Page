            Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer
            scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly
            influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of
            algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
            computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
            artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home
            country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his work was
            covered by the Official Secrets Act.
