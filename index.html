            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer
                scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly
                influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the
                concepts of
                algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
                computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
                artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home
                country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his work
                was
                covered by the Official Secrets Act.
            </p>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.</p>
            <h2>Mid Life</h2>
            <p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley
                Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the
                section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for
                speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
                electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat
                the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win
                the war.</p>
            <h2>Late Life</h2>
