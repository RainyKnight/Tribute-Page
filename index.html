                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer
                    scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly
                    influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the
                    concepts of
                    algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a
                    general-purpose
                    computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
                    artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home
                    country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his
                    work
                    was
                    covered by the Official Secrets Act.

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p> Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23rd 1912 in
                    Maida Vale, London, England.</p>
                <p>Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. His
                    parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The
                    location is also marked with a blue plaque.</p>

            <article id="mid-life">
                <h2>Mid Life</h2>
                <p>Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was
                    awarded first-class honours in mathematics.</p>
                <p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at
                    Bletchley
                    Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the
                    section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques
                    for
                    speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method,
                    an
                    electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to
                    defeat
                    the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped
                    win
                    the war.</p>

                <h2>Late Life</h2>
                <p>On June 8th 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41; he had died the previous day.
                    Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. When his body was discovered, an apple lay
                    half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated
                    that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had
                    committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that
                    Turing
                    was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his
                    favourite
                    fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the
                    scene
                    where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew". Turing's remains were cremated at
                    Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium,
                    just as his father's had been.</p>

                <h2>Conviction of Indecency</h2>
                <p>In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old
                    unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met
                    Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was
                    burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime
                    to
                    the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual
                    acts
                    were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[133] and both men were charged with
                    "gross
                    indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.</p>
                <P>Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea
                    of
                    guilty.[135] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[136]
                    Turing
                    was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be
                    conditional
                    on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido. He accepted the
                    option
                    of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES).</P>

                <h2>The Turing Test</h2>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">
                    The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a
                    machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of
                    a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a
                    human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one
                    of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one
                    another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and
                    screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the
                    evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the
                    test. The test results do not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions,
                    only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give.</blockquote>
