            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer
                scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly
                influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the
                concepts of
                algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
                computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
                artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home
                country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his work
                was
                covered by the Official Secrets Act.
            </p>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p> Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23rd 1912 in
                Maida Vale, London, England.</p>
            <p>Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. His
                parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The
                location is also marked with a blue plaque.</p>
            <h2>Mid Life</h2>
            <p>Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge,[7] where he was
                awarded first-class honours in mathematics.</p>
            <p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley
                Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the
                section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for
                speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
                electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat
                the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win
                the war.</p>
            <h2>Conviction of Indecency</h2>
            <p>In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old
                unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met
                Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was
                burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to
                the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts
                were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[133] and both men were charged with "gross
                indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.</p>
            <P>Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of
                guilty.[135] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[136] Turing
                was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional
                on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option
                of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES)</P>
            <h2>Late Life</h2>
            <p>On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41; he had died the previous day.
                Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. When his body was discovered, an apple lay
                half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated
                that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had
                committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing
                was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite
                fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene
                where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew". Turing's remains were cremated at
                Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium,
                just as his father's had been.</p>
